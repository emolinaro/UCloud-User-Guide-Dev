# Private Cloud

With UCloud you can provision anything from bare-bone virtual machines available via terminal to complete software solutions in just a few seconds.
The cloud infrastructure natively supports multitenancy, with a separation between data and computing resources.

All cloud services are accessible via every type of device, from workstations to laptops and tablets.

The platform runs on premises hosted at the University of Southern Denmark, but it can also be used independently.
