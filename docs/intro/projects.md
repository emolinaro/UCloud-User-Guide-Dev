# Workspaces

With UCloud you can create and manage virtual workspaces dedicated to your projects, to share resources and work together with your collaborators.
There is no limit to how many projects you create and how many team members you have in your project.
You and your team can provision virtual HPC environments in seconds and share your results together.

[Projects workspaces](../guide/project-intro.md) give you an easier and more streamlined way of collaborating in larger teams with a much easier management of access control to the files and resources available to the project.
