# Resource Allocation

The UCloud interface the user allows to access and use resources on different [national HPC systems](https://www.deic.dk/en/supercomputing/national-hpc-facilities), which are called [providers](providers.md). These resources are always assigned through [grant applications](resources-grant.md), which are submitted via the same interface.
