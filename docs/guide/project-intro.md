# Project Workspace

On UCloud it is possible to create collaborative workspaces designed for teams, named *projects*.
These spaces are suitable to accommodate complex research workflows and share resources.

In a UCloud project teams can:

- Store and manage big data.
- Create groups of collaborators with different tasks.
- Assign special permissions to access the data.
- Distribute resources in subprojects.
- Grant access to software licenses.
- Submit grant applications to allocate new resources.

Access rights within the project storage system are defined by a number of *roles*, primarily to be able to manage security and access control for project members.
