On the top of this page the user can see all the apps marked as _favorites_. An app can be added to this list for easy access in the future, by hovering on the app card and clicking on the small red bookmark on the top-right corner.

In the *Featured* list the user can find a selection of frequently used interactive applications.

Other cards are organized in categories and application tools. By clicking on *show all*, the user can access the complete list of items belonging to the same category/tool.

Every app belongs to one or more categories, which are highlighted with a tag at the bottom of the app card or tool block.
The complete list of tags, together with the corresponding apps, is reported [here](../Apps/tags.md).
