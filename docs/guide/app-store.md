# Apps Portal

The full catalogue of apps stored on UCloud includes both traditional batch HPC application types and interactive tools for software development, data engineering, big data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

The next sections will give an overview of the UCloud _app service_ together with general guidelines on how to submit a job via the web interface.

In the third part of the user guide, dedicated to [supported apps](../Apps/type.md), a more detailed discussion about the different application types is presented, as well as extensive tutorials on how to use some of the featured apps of the catalogue.
