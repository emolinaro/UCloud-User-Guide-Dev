# Virtual Machine

UCloud provides few apps that start [Virtual Machines](https://cloud.sdu.dk/app/applications?tag=Virtual%20Machines&itemsPerPage=25&page=0) (VMs) based on different Linux operating systems.

``` {note}
Once the application is launched on UCloud, the VM is accessed via SSH.
```

The complete list of apps used to deploy VMs is reported [here](../tags/VMs.md).
