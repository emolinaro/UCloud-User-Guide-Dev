# Interactive Computing

UCloud supports interactive exploration of data via web-based applications. These typically include data analytics tools and dashboards for data mining and visualization.

When the job status of an interactive app is set to _running_, it is possible to launch the software web interface by clicking on the button

The software graphical interface can be opened multiple times within different web browsers.
